# Singly Linked List
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Be sure to follow your language/frameworks standard naming conventions (e.g. C# uses PascalCasing for all method and class names).

Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be contextual, descriptive, capture-able errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.

Write tests to prove the following functionality:

Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
Can properly insert into the linked list
The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list
Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.

## Challenge
Create a Linked List class
Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
The class should contain the following methods
insert
Arguments: value
Returns: nothing
Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
includes
Arguments: value
Returns: Boolean
Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
to string
Arguments: none
Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

## Approach & Efficiency
DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
Separate code into blocks

Time: O(n)
SPace: O(n)

## API
none

# Linked List Insertions

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class.

Write tests to prove the following functionality:

Can successfully add a node to the end of the linked list
Can successfully add multiple nodes to the end of a linked list
Can successfully insert a node before a node located i the middle of a linked list
Can successfully insert a node before the first node of a linked list
Can successfully insert after a node in the middle of the linked list
Can successfully insert a node after the last node of the linked list
Unit tests must be passing before you submit your final solution code.

# Challenge Summary
Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

append
arguments: new value
adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
insert before
arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified
insert after
arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified
