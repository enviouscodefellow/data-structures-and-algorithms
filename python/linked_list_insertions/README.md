# Linked List Insertions

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class.

Write tests to prove the following functionality:

Can successfully add a node to the end of the linked list
Can successfully add multiple nodes to the end of a linked list
Can successfully insert a node before a node located i the middle of a linked list
Can successfully insert a node before the first node of a linked list
Can successfully insert after a node in the middle of the linked list
Can successfully insert a node after the last node of the linked list
Unit tests must be passing before you submit your final solution code.

# Challenge Summary
Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

append
arguments: new value
adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
insert before
arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified
insert after
arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified
